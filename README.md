# Tree of Life
Tree of Life is a project for the module IS306 Interaction Design and Prototyping. It is a prototype for a web/mobile app for parents to talk to one another regarding their children and to record moments and memories of them.

The project mainly focuses on prototyping but do feel free to provide comments regarding the coding style and conventions etc.

This is the first time the team is using Meteor, React and Semantic UI. We're looking to improve in whatever ways we can! :)
